Hello,  

This is Aaron Lee's and David Penn's Calculus AB Project for the year of 2017.  
Our project is over finding the rates of a sphere dissolving at a constant radius  
rate.   

To get to our project follow these simple steps:  

	~ Ensure all contents downloaded from Classroom are in the same folder.  
	~ Find the file called "index.html"(Make sure not to click "index1.html"!).  
	~ Once the file is located, double click and it will open in your browser.  
	~ It is recommended to use our website in Google Chrome as it will be most  
	  optimized for our project.  
	~ Finally, you can now browse throughout our hand crafted webpage!  

Special Notes:  

	~ We tried to get the domain "clarkisthebomb.com" but David couldn't  
	  get the server set up in a reasonable way because his router and   
	  Linux server threw a fit just when he needed it to work!  
	~ The "Main" page is just a page for you to play with. Our work that  
	  you would like to grade is in the "Explanation" tab, but the graphs  
	  in "Main" are, as you can tell by the buttons, "Experiment" and our  
	  "Predicted".
	~ If you have any problems, contact Tech Support   
	  at 18penndavid@canyonstudent.net and he will try his best to help you through  
	  the technical issue. You can also call him into class in any period besides   
	  4th if you need to as well.  If David for some reason died in the next   
	  couple of weeks, contact Aaron at 18leeaaron@canyonstudent.net!    
	~ Yes, we are the most insane people and made a webpage for our project.  
	  You might've been joking about it the first day you asigned it, but we actually  
	  did it!
